<H3>Welcome!</H3>

<p>Semantic representation is receiving growing attention in NLP in the past few years, and many proposals for semantic
    schemes have recently been put forth. Examples include Abstract Meaning Representation <span class="citation"
                                                                                                 data-cites="banarescu2013abstract"></span>,
    Broad-coverage Semantic Dependencies <span class="citation" data-cites="oepen2016towards"></span>, Universal
    Decompositional Semantics <span class="citation" data-cites="white2016universal"></span>, Parallel Meaning Bank
    <span class="citation" data-cites="abzianidze2017the"></span>, and Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation <span
            class="citation" data-cites="abend2013universal"></span>. These advances in semantic representation, along
    with corresponding advances in semantic parsing, hold promise to benefit essentially all text understanding tasks, and
    have already demonstrated applicability to summarization <span class="citation"
                                                                   data-cites="liu2015toward Dohare2017TextSU"></span>,
    paraphrase detection <span class="citation" data-cites="issa-18"></span>, and semantic evaluation (using UCCA; see
    below).</p>
<p>In addition to their potential applicative value, work on semantic parsing poses interesting algorithmic and modeling
    challenges, which are often different from those tackled in syntactic parsing, including reentrancy (e.g., for
    sharing arguments across predicates), and the modeling of the interface with lexical semantics. Semantic parsing
    into such schemes has been much advanced by recent SemEval workshops, including two tasks on Broad-coverage Semantic
    Dependency Parsing <span class="citation" data-cites="oepen2014semeval oepen2015semeval"></span> and two tasks on
    AMR parsing <span class="citation" data-cites="may2016semeval may2017semeval"></span>. We expect that a SemEval task
    on UCCA parsing to have a similar effect. Moreover, given the conceptual similarity between the different semantic
    representations <span class="citation" data-cites="abend2017state"></span>, it is likely that work on UCCA parsing
    will directly contribute to the development of other semantic parsing technology. Furthermore, conversion scripts
    are available between UCCA and the SDP and AMR formats.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>1</sup></a>
    We encourage teams that participated in past shared tasks on AMR and SDP, to participate using
    similar systems and a conversion-based protocol.</p>
<p>UCCA is a cross-linguistically applicable semantic representation scheme, building on the established Basic
    Linguistic Theory typological framework <span class="citation" data-cites="Dixon:10a Dixon:10b Dixon:12"></span>. It
    has demonstrated applicability to multiple languages, including English, French and German (with pilot annotation
    projects on Czech, Russian and Hebrew), and stability under translation <span class="citation"
                                                                                  data-cites="sulem2015conceptual"></span>
    . It has proven useful for defining semantic evaluation measures for text-to-text generation tasks, including
    machine translation <span class="citation" data-cites="birch2016hume"></span>, text simplification <span
            class="citation" data-cites="sulem2018semantic"></span> and grammatical error correction <span
            class="citation" data-cites="choshen2018reference"></span> (see §<a href="#sec:applications"
                                                                                data-reference-type="ref"
                                                                                data-reference="sec:applications">[sec:applications]</a>).

<p>UCCA supports rapid annotation by non-experts, assisted by an accessible annotation interface <span class="citation"
                                                                                                       data-cites="abend2017uccaapp"></span>.
    The interface is powered by an open-source, flexible web-application for syntactic and semantic phrase-based
    annotation in general, and for UCCA annotation in particular.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
                                                                    id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="sec:task_definition">Task Definition</h1>
<p>UCCA represents the semantics of linguistic utterances as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where terminal (childless)
    nodes correspond to the text tokens, and non-terminal nodes to semantic units that participate in some
    super-ordinate relation. Edges are labeled, indicating the role of a child in the relation the parent represents.
    Nodes and edges belong to one of several <em>layers</em>, each corresponding to a “module” of semantic distinctions.
</p>
<p>UCCA’s <em>foundational layer</em> covers the predicate-argument structure evoked by predicates of all grammatical
    categories (verbal, nominal, adjectival and others), the inter-relations between them, and other major linguistic
    phenomena such as semantic heads and multi-word expressions. It is the only layer for which annotated corpora exist
    at the moment, and will thus be the target of this shared task. The layer’s basic notion is the <em>Scene</em>,
    describing a state, action, movement or some other relation that evolves in time. Each Scene contains one main
    relation (marked as either a Process or a State), as well as one or more Participants. For example, the sentence
    “After graduation, John moved to Paris” (Figure <a href="#fig:example" data-reference-type="ref"
                                                       data-reference="fig:example">[fig:example]</a>) contains two
    Scenes, whose main relations are “graduation” and “moved”. “John” is a Participant in both Scenes, while “Paris”
    only in the latter. Further categories account for inter-Scene relations and the internal structure of complex
    arguments and relations (e.g. coordination, multi-word expressions and modification).</p>
<p>UCCA distinguishes <em>primary</em> edges, corresponding to explicit relations, from <em>remote</em> edges (appear
    dashed in Figure <a href="#fig:example" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:example">[fig:example]</a>)
    that allow for a unit to participate in several super-ordinate relations. Primary edges form a tree in each layer,
    whereas remote edges enable reentrancy, forming a DAG.</p>
<p>UCCA graphs may contain <em>implicit</em> units with no correspondent in the text. Figure <a
        href="#fig:example_implicit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:example_implicit">[fig:example_implicit]</a>
    shows the annotation for the sentence “A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as
    cotton, soybeans and rice.”. The sentence was used by <span class="citation" data-cites="oepen2015semeval"></span>
    to compare different semantic dependency schemes. It includes a single Scene, whose main relation is “apply”, a
    secondary relation “almost impossible”, as well as two complex arguments: “a similar technique” and the coordinated
    argument “such as cotton, soybeans, and rice.” In addition, the Scene includes an implicit argument, which
    represents the agent of the “apply” relation.</p>
<p>While parsing technology is well-established for syntactic parsing, UCCA has several distinct properties that
    distinguish it from syntactic representations, mostly UCCA’s tendency to abstract away from syntactic detail that do
    not affect argument structure. For instance, consider the following examples where the concept of a Scene has a
    different rationale from the syntactic concept of a clause. First, non-verbal predicates in UCCA are represented
    like verbal ones, such as when they appear in copula clauses or noun phrases. Indeed, in Figure <a
            href="#fig:example" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:example">[fig:example]</a>, “graduation”
    and “moved” are considered separate Scenes, despite appearing in the same clause. Second, in the same example,
    “John” is marked as a (remote) Participant in the graduation Scene, despite not being explicitly mentioned. Third,
    consider the possessive construction in “John’s trip home”. While in UCCA “trip” evokes a Scene in which “John” is a
    Participant, a syntactic scheme would analyze this phrase similarly to “John’s shoes”.</p>
<p>The differences in the challenges posed by syntactic parsing and UCCA parsing, and more generally semantic parsing,
    motivate the development of targeted parsing technology to tackle it.</p>
