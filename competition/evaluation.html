<H3>Evaluation Criteria</H3>

<h4 id="submission-conditions.">Submission conditions.</h4>
<p>Participants in the task will be evaluated in four settings:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p>English in-domain setting, using the Wiki corpus.</p></li>
    <li><p>English out-of-domain setting, using the Wiki corpus as training and development data, and 20K Leagues as
        test data.</p></li>
    <li><p>German in-domain setting, using the 20K Leagues corpus.</p></li>
    <li><p>French setting with no training data, using the 20K Leagues as development and test data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to allow both even ground comparison between systems and using hitherto untried resources, we will hold both
    an <strong>open</strong> and a <strong>closed</strong> track for submissions in the English and German settings.
    Closed track submissions will only be allowed to use the gold-standard UCCA annotation distributed for the task in
    the target language, and will be limited in their use of additional resources. Concretely, the additional data they
    will be allowed to use will only consist of that used by TUPA, which consists of automatic annotations provided by
    spaCy <span class="citation" data-cites="spacy2"></span>:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
                                                                id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> POS tags, syntactic
    dependency relations, and named entity types and spans. In addition, the closed track will allow the use of word
    embeddings provided by fastText <span class="citation" data-cites="bojanowski2016enriching"></span><a href="#fn2"
                                                                                                          class="footnote-ref"
                                                                                                          id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    for all languages.</p>
<p>Systems in the open track, on the other hand, will be allowed to use any additional resource, such as UCCA annotation
    in other languages, dictionaries or datasets for other tasks, provided that they make sure not to use any additional
    gold standard annotation over the same text used in the UCCA corpora.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
                                                                            id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In both tracks,
    we will require that submitted systems will not be trained on the development data. Due to the absence of an
    established pilot study for French, we will only hold an open track for this setting.</p>
<p>The four settings and two tracks result in a total of 7 competitions, where a team may participate in anywhere
    between 1 and 7 of them. We will encourage submissions in each track to use their systems to produce results in all
    settings. In addition, we will encourage closed-track submissions to also submit to the open track.</p>
<h4 id="scoring.">Scoring.</h4>
<p>In order to evaluate how similar an output UCCA structure is to a gold UCCA graph, we use <span><em>DAG <span
        class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span>-score</em></span>. Formally, over two UCCA annotations <span
        class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span> that share their set of leaves
    (tokens) <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and for a node <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in <span
            class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span>, define its yield <span
            class="math inline">\(yield(v) \subseteq W\)</span> as its set of leaf descendants. Define a pair of edges
    <span class="math inline">\((v_1,u_1) \in G_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((v_2,u_2) \in G_2\)</span> to
    be matching if <span class="math inline">\(yield(u_1) = yield(u_2)\)</span> and they have the same label. Labeled
    precision and recall are defined by dividing the number of matching edges in <span
            class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span> by <span
            class="math inline">\(|E_1|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|E_2|\)</span> respectively. <span><em>DAG <span
            class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span>-score</em></span> is their harmonic mean.</p>
